"Setting up a project to use Dear Imgui along with its relevant backends, using the VCPKG package manager in visual studio."

VCPKG STUFF:

Installation 
--having installed vcpkg within the root directory, or if not simply clone the existing public vcpkg repo (https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git)
--navigate to the cloned vcpkg repository, and run the following cmd (.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat)
COMMANDS USED IN THE ABOVE SECTION :
1: git clone git@github.com:microsoft/vcpkg.git
2: ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

Usage 
--having vcpkg installed, we can now install libraries and packages using the "./" followed by the word "vcpkg" within the installation directory
--to install packages run (./vcpkg install [pkg-name]:x86-windows)
--to search pacakges run (./vcpkg search [pkg-name])
COMMANDS USED IN THE ABOVE SECTION : 
1: ./vcpkg install [pkg-name]:x86-windows
2: ./vcpkg search [pkg-name]

Visual Studio Integration
--after having the necessary packages installed, run the following cmd (./vcpkg integrate install)
COMMANDS USED IN THE ABOVE SECTION : 
1: ./vcpkg integrate install


VISUAL STUDIO STUFF :

Installation
--Download the latest visual studio community edition release binaries, and have it installed on your system with most of the options checked within the installation window for general application development 
--Launch visual studio and create an emtpy project.

Library Linkage and setup
Using the "DearImgui" library example along with the "opengl3" and "glfw" bindings.
NOTE: opengl resides in a library "glad", which is what was installed using the vcpkg pkg manager.
--firstly, create an emtpy visual studio project and navigate the project properties by right clicking.
--the things we have to tinker with in the properties window, require the access to "LINKER" and "VC++" section from the left pane.

*LINKER SECTION:
--in the left pane, underneath the linker section, have "input" selected
--navigate to the newly opened right pane, and add entries to the area labelled with "Additional Dependencies" with the names of the libraries you intend upon using in your project.
--in this case, the names of the libraries we are including are (glad.lib imgui.lib glfw3dll.lib)
NOTE: If unsure, about the libraries to be used, navigate to (D:/software projects/vcpkg/installed/x86-windows/lib) and check out the relevant libraries to list.
Path for this section : (project->properties->linker->input->Additional Dependencies:[imgui.lib glad.lib glfw3dll.lib])

--after having the work done under the "Input" tab, navigate to the "General" tab from the left pane under the "LINKER".
--after having the "General" tab selected, select "Additional Libraries Dependencies" from the right pane.
--under the "Additional Libraries Dependencies", list down the path of the libraries from the vcpkg installation directory.
--for our case, the path will look like (D:/software projects/vcpkg/installed/x86-windows/lib/imgui.lib)
                                        (D:/software projects/vcpkg/installed/x86-windows/lib/glfw3dll.lib)
                                        (D:/software projects/vcpkg/installed/x86-windows/glad.lib)
Path for this section : (project->properties->linker->general->Additional Libraries Dependencies: [D:/software projects/vcpks/installed/x86-windows/lib/imgui.lib])
LINKER SECTION DONE



*CONFIGURATION PROPERTIES SECTION
--under the configuration properties section under project properties in visual studio, navigate to the "VC++ Directories" , from the left pane.
--In the newly opened right pane, select "Include Directories" and add the path of the "include" dir from the vcpkg installed directory.
NOTE : the include directory resides with in the vcpkg "installed" directory under the "x86-windows" directory, since u have 32 bit libs installed.
NOTE:  only the path to the include directory is needed to be added under the "Include Directries" under "VC++ Directories", and not for each indvidual header or c++ files.
Path for this section : (projec->properties->configuration properties->VC++ Directorie-> Include Directories : [D:/software projects/vcpkg/installed/x86-windows/include])
Configuration Properties Section DONE


VOILA! now you can continue creating new files and adding code for imgui, within the header of c++ files.
VCPKG LINKAGE FOR VISUAL STUDIO DONE :)
