Dear Imgui Kickstarter, is a repo holding information for linking vcpkg libraries within a visual studio project.

For starters, head over to "verbose-visualstudio-setup.txt"
to get a detailed guide, for working out with vcpkg libs in your visual studio project.

This Repo takes the infamous example of Dear Imgui library along with its "GLFW" and "OPENGL (glad library)" bindings, and configures a visual studio project to get it up and running using these libraries.
